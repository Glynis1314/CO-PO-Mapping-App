Security policy

If you believe you've found a security vulnerability, please open a private issue or contact the repository owner. Do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been resolved.

Suggested process:
- Create a private issue with steps to reproduce and impact.
- Tag maintainers and propose a fix or remediation plan.
- After fix/review, disclose following coordinated disclosure practices.
