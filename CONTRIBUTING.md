Contributing

Thanks for contributing! A short guide:

- Fork → branch → open a PR with a clear description.
- Keep changes small and focused; include tests for new behavior.
- Follow existing code style; run `flake8`/`black` if configured.
- CI runs on push — make sure tests pass before requesting review.

For major changes, open an issue first to discuss the approach.
